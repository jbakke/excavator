The purpose of this repo is to store code in a place where changes won't affect the sandbox server (important when the code contains bugs but I still want to share it) and where changes will be tracked.

Not all files are tracked; only files that I might have a reason to change are tracked. This essentially excludes Sencha's sdk files and css, images, etc. that are the same for every Sencha app.

In testing, it is assumed that the data server with which Sencha communicates is hosted on port 8000 of the same computer, so from Sencha it can be accessed at 'http://'+document.location.hostname+':8000'.
